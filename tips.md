https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin/swigwin-3.0.12/swigwin-3.0.12.zip/download?use_mirror=excellmedia

1- copy swig.exe to the python installation folder (for ex C:/python27)

2- open swigwin-3.0.12/Lib folder and copy all *.swg files to the C:/python27/lib or equivalent python path

3- Open swigwin-3.0.12/lib/python and copy all the files to (C:/python27/lib)

(Also make sure you have Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python installed)
